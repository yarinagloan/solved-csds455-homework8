<strong>Problem 1</strong>: Let <em>κ</em>(<em>G</em>) be the connectivity of <em>G</em>, let <em>λ</em>(<em>G</em>) be the edge connectivity of <em>G</em>, and let <em>δ</em>(<em>G</em>) be the minimum degree of <em>G</em>. Prove that <em>κ</em>(<em>G</em>) ≤ <em>λ</em>(<em>G</em>) ≤ <em>δ</em>(<em>G</em>) (assuming <em>G </em>has at least two vertices).

<strong>Problem 2</strong>: The <em>d</em>-dimensional cube is a graph with 2<em><sup>d </sup></em>vertices. Each vertex has a unique label of {0<em>,</em>1}<em><sup>d </sup></em>(each label is a unique sequence of <em>d </em>0’s and 1’s), and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their labels differ in exactly one position. Determine the connectivity of the <em>d</em>-dimensional cube.

<strong>Problem 3</strong>: Find the smallest 3-regular (simple) graph with connectivity 1, and prove your answer.

<strong>Problem 4</strong>: Let <em>G </em>be a connected graph in which for every edge <em>e </em>there are cycles <em>C</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>C</em><sub>2 </sub>both containing <em>e </em>and for which <em>e </em>is their only common edge. Prove that <em>G </em>is 3-edge-connected.
